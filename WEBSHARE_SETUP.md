# Webshare.io Proxy Setup Guide

This guide explains how to integrate webshare.io's free proxies to bypass YouTube's IP blocking.

## Why Webshare.io?

YouTube blocks cloud provider IPs (Replit, AWS, GCP, Netlify). Webshare.io provides:
- âœ… **10 FREE datacenter proxies** (no credit card required)
- âœ… **1GB bandwidth/month** (enough for ~300-500 transcript requests)
- âœ… **Forever free** (no trial expiration)
- âœ… **Residential IPs** available for upgrade if needed

---

## Step 1: Sign Up for Webshare.io

1. Go to: **https://www.webshare.io**
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Create a free account (no credit card required)
4. Verify your email

---

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Log in to **https://dashboard.webshare.io**
2. Click **"API"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Generate New Token"**
4. **Copy the API key** (it looks like: `abc123xyz456...`)
5. **Save it securely** - you'll need this for Netlify

---

## Step 3: Add API Key to Netlify

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com/sites/ai-pm-youtube/configuration/env**
2. Scroll to **"Environment variables"**
3. Click **"Add a variable"**
4. Add:
   - **Key**: `WEBSHARE_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `<your API key from step 2>`
5. Click **"Save"**
6. **Redeploy your site**: 
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"

---

## Step 4: Test the Integration

After redeployment, test with this URL:

```
https://ai-pm-youtube.netlify.app/api/transcript-proxy?videoId=jNQXAC9IVRw&languages=en
```

**Expected result:**
```json
{
  "videoId": "jNQXAC9IVRw",
  "language": "en",
  "fullText": "Welcome to YouTube. The first video ever uploaded..."
}
```

If you see `fullText` with actual content (not empty), **it's working!** ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works

### Request Flow with Proxies:

```
User clicks "Pull Transcript"
    â†“
Netlify Function fetches proxy list from webshare.io
    â†“
Uses proxy to request transcript from YouTube
    â†“
YouTube sees proxy IP (not blocked) â†’ Returns transcript
    â†“
Netlify Function returns transcript to Replit
    â†“
Replit saves transcript to database
```

### Proxy Rotation:

- The function caches the proxy list for 5 minutes
- If one proxy fails, it tries another
- Up to 3 retry attempts with different proxies

---

## Monitoring Usage

### Check Webshare.io Dashboard:

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.webshare.io**
2. View **"Bandwidth usage"** in the overview
3. See **"Proxy list"** to check which proxies are active

### Free Tier Limits:

- **10 proxies** (rotates through them)
- **1GB bandwidth/month** 
- Each transcript fetch uses ~5-50KB
- Estimated: **300-500 transcripts/month**

### If You Hit the Limit:

**Option 1: Upgrade to Paid** ($2.99/month for 100 proxies)
**Option 2: Wait until next month** (resets on billing date)
**Option 3: Use Python fallback** (works in development on Replit)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Empty Transcripts?

1. **Check Netlify logs**:
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/ai-pm-youtube/functions
   - Click "fetch-transcript"
   - Look for errors like "403 Forbidden" or "Proxy connection failed"

2. **Verify API key is correct**:
   - Go to Netlify environment variables
   - Make sure `WEBSHARE_API_KEY` is set
   - No extra spaces or quotes

3. **Test API key manually**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://proxy.webshare.io/api/v2/proxy/list/
   ```
   Should return your proxy list

### "Transcripts are disabled" Error

This means YouTube is still blocking the request. Possible causes:
- Webshare's datacenter proxies are also blocked
- Need to upgrade to **residential proxies** ($4.50/GB)
- The specific video has transcripts disabled

### "Failed to fetch proxies" in Logs

- API key is missing or invalid
- Webshare.io API is down (rare)
- Network connectivity issue from Netlify

## Upgrade Options

If free tier doesn't work or you need more:

### Webshare.io Pricing:

| Plan | Proxies | Bandwidth | Price |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Free** | 10 datacenter | 1GB/month | $0 |
| **Starter** | 100 datacenter | 100GB/month | $2.99/month |
| **Residential** | Rotating pool | Pay per GB | $4.50/GB |

**Recommendation**: Start with free tier, upgrade to residential if needed.

---

## Alternative: Residential Proxies

If datacenter proxies are blocked:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.webshare.io
2. Click **"Proxies"** â†’ **"Get proxies"**
3. Select **"Residential proxies"**
4. Add funds (minimum $10)
5. Use the same API key (it auto-switches to residential)

Residential proxies use **real home IPs** that YouTube cannot block.

If issues persist:
1. Check Netlify function logs for detailed errors
2. Verify API key is correct in environment variables
3. Test API key directly with curl command above
4. Contact webshare.io support: support@webshare.io
