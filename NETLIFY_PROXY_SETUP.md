# Netlify Proxy Setup Guide

## Overview

This solution uses a **Netlify Function** to proxy YouTube transcript requests, bypassing Replit's blocked IPs.

### Why This Works
- âœ… Netlify has different IP addresses than Replit
- âœ… Netlify's IPs may not be blocked by YouTube
- âœ… Free tier available (125K requests/month)
- âœ… Works in Replit's containerized environment (unlike Tor)
- âœ… Fast and reliable

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push this repo to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add netlify/ netlify.toml package.json
   git commit -m "Add Netlify Function for transcript proxy"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Go to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com/

3. **Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"**

4. **Connect to GitHub** and select your `youtube-intel-scan` repository

5. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Publish directory: `.`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

6. **Click "Deploy site"**

7. **Your site will be deployed** at something like:
   `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

#### Option B: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

### Step 2: Test the Netlify Function

Once deployed, test your function:

**Test URL format:**
```
https://your-site-name.netlify.app/api/transcript-proxy?videoId=jNQXAC9IVRw&languages=en
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl "https://your-site-name.netlify.app/api/transcript-proxy?videoId=jNQXAC9IVRw&languages=en"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "videoId": "jNQXAC9IVRw",
  "language": "English",
  "languageCode": "en",
  "isGenerated": false,
  "snippets": [
    {
      "text": "Welcome to...",
      "start": 0.0,
      "duration": 2.5
    }
  ],
  "fullText": "Welcome to YouTube..."
}
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Replit to Use Netlify Proxy

#### In Replit Secrets (or Environment Variables):

Add two secrets:

1. **USE_NETLIFY_PROXY**
   - Value: `true`

2. **NETLIFY_PROXY_URL**
   - Value: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
   - (Replace with your actual Netlify site URL)

#### Or edit `.replit` file:

```toml
[env]
PORT = "5000"
USE_NETLIFY_PROXY = "true"
NETLIFY_PROXY_URL = "https://your-site-name.netlify.app"
```

---

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

1. **Deploy to Replit production**

2. **Test at**: https://ai-pm-youtube.replit.app/videos

3. **Try downloading a transcript**

4. **Check logs** for:
   ```
   INFO - Using Netlify proxy for video <VIDEO_ID>
   INFO - Fetching via Netlify proxy: https://your-site-name.netlify.app/api/transcript-proxy
   INFO - Successfully fetched transcript for <VIDEO_ID>
   ```

---

## How It Works

### The Flow

```
User Request (Replit)
    â†“
Python Script checks USE_NETLIFY_PROXY
    â†“
Makes HTTP request to Netlify Function
    â†“
Netlify Function fetches from YouTube
    â†“
Returns transcript to Python Script
    â†“
Returns to user
```

### Why This Bypasses Blocking

1. **Different IP pool**: Netlify uses different IP addresses than Replit
2. **Better reputation**: Netlify's IPs may not be on YouTube's blocklist
3. **Separation of concerns**: YouTube sees Netlify, not Replit

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: 404 Error

**Symptoms:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Netlify Function is deployed:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site-name/functions
   - You should see `fetch-transcript` listed

2. Check the URL format:
   - Should be: `/api/transcript-proxy` (not `/.netlify/functions/fetch-transcript`)
   - The `netlify.toml` redirect handles this

3. Test directly:
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-site-name.netlify.app/api/transcript-proxy?videoId=jNQXAC9IVRw"
   ```

---

### Problem: "Transcripts are disabled for this video"

**Symptoms:**
```json
{"error":"Transcripts are disabled for this video"}
```

**Solutions:**
1. This is a **legitimate error** for that specific video
2. Try a different video that you know has transcripts
3. Test with a known-good video ID: `jNQXAC9IVRw`

---

### Problem: Empty transcript

**Symptoms:**
```json
{"videoId":"...","fullText":""}
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check Netlify Function logs:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site-name/functions
   - Click on `fetch-transcript`
   - View real-time logs

2. Verify `youtube-transcript` package is installed:
   - Check `package.json` includes: `"youtube-transcript": "^1.2.1"`
   - Redeploy if needed

---

### Problem: CORS errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Access to fetch at '...' from origin '...' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solutions:**
1. CORS should be configured in `netlify/functions/fetch-transcript.js`
2. Check headers include:
   ```javascript
   'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
   ```

3. If restricting origins, update to:
   ```javascript
   'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://ai-pm-youtube.replit.app'
   ```

---

### Problem: Netlify still getting blocked

**Symptoms:**
Same blocking errors even with Netlify proxy

**Solutions:**
1. **Try residential proxies** through Netlify:
   - Add proxy service (Webshare, etc.) to Netlify Function
   - Update function to use the proxy

2. **Rate limiting**:
   - Add delays between requests
   - Implement request queuing

3. **Fallback strategy**:
   - Try Netlify first
   - Fall back to direct request
   - Show clear error messages

---

## Cost

### Netlify Free Tier

- âœ… 125,000 function requests/month
- âœ… 100 GB bandwidth/month
- âœ… Perfect for moderate usage

### Upgrade if Needed

- **Pro Plan**: $19/month
  - 2M function requests/month
  - 400 GB bandwidth/month

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Example | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `USE_NETLIFY_PROXY` | Yes | `true` | Enable Netlify proxy |
| `NETLIFY_PROXY_URL` | Yes | `https://your-site.netlify.app` | Your Netlify site URL |
| `USE_TOR_PROXY` | No | `false` | Disable Tor (not compatible with Replit) |

---

## Monitoring

### Check Netlify Function Usage

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site-name/functions
2. View function invocations
3. Monitor usage against free tier limits

### Check Netlify Logs

Real-time logs show:
- Each request
- Success/failure
- Error details

---

## Next Steps After Setup

1. âœ… Deploy Netlify Function
2. âœ… Test the function URL directly
3. âœ… Configure Replit environment variables
4. âœ… Deploy to Replit production
5. âœ… Test transcript downloads
6. âœ… Monitor success rate

### If Success Rate < 90%

Consider adding a residential proxy to the Netlify Function:
- Sign up for Webshare ($3-10/month)
- Add proxy support to `fetch-transcript.js`
- Update environment variables
